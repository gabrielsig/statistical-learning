# Introduction to Statistical Learning - Book Study

**This is still a work in progress**

This repository is composed of my study materials on the Introduction to Statistical Learning book. You will find my **notes**, **labs** and **exercises** notebooks for each of the chapters of the book. 

**Note:** I am by no means an expert on the subject, this are my first steps into the machine learning world. That being the case, if you intend to use the contents of this repository as a reference, do it with caution. Also, I gladly accept suggestions for improvements!!
